## Add or change a Translation üìöÔ∏è

Adding and changing translations help make the simulator accessible to a wider audience.

Here‚Äôs how you can contribute a new or existing translation:

- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- **Locate Translation Files**: Navigate to the `translations` directory containing the translation files.
- **Create a New Translation File** or **Change an existing translation**: You can copy an existing translation file (e.g., `en.json` for English) and rename it to match the language code of the new translation (please respect the [ISO-639 language code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) for the new language - e.g. `es.json` for Spanish, `it.json` fir Italian, ...).
- **Translate the Strings**: Open the file and translate each string into the target language. Ensure that the keys remain unchanged.
- **Test the Translation**: If possible, test the new translation within the application to ensure accuracy and completeness. (See [deploy locally](https://github.com/odysseu/HabitatCalc/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy-locally-) if you're unsure of how to do so before commiting your changes)
- **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes with a clear message and push them to your fork.
- **Open a Pull Request**: Create a pull request, explaining which language you‚Äôve added and any relevant details.
